## Machine Learning Engineering Issue ü§ñ

Hello, Team software member!
Please use this template to document and track ML engineering tasks and issues.
Not every section is required.
When in doubt, provide an initial guess as basis for discussion.
After reviewing the issue, we'll update as needed.

### Issue Overview üìã

**Issue Name:** [Provide a concise, descriptive name for the ML engineering issue]

**Type of Issue:** [e.g., Model Performance, Data Pipeline, Deployment, Monitoring, etc.]

**Related Model/Project:** [Specify the ML model or project this issue relates to]

### Specific Details üî¨

**Issue Description:** [Provide a detailed description of the issue. Include context, observed behavior, and any relevant metrics or logs.]

**Expected Behavior:** [Describe what the expected behavior or outcome should be once this issue is resolved.]

**Proposed Solution:** [If you have ideas on how to address this issue, outline them here. Include potential approaches or techniques to investigate.]

**Technical Details:**
- ML Framework/Libraries: [List relevant ML frameworks and libraries, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn]
- Data Involved: [Describe any datasets or data sources relevant to this issue]
- Environment: [Specify the environment where this issue occurs, e.g., development, staging, production]

### To-Do List üìù
- [ ] Investigate root cause
- [ ] Develop solution approach
- [ ] Implement changes
- [ ] Test and validate solution
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Deploy to production (if applicable)

### Impact Assessment üìä

**Business Impact:** [Describe how this issue affects business objectives or model performance]
**Users/Systems Affected:** [Estimate the number of users or systems impacted]

### Priority

**Priority:** [Select one: `!p0`/`!p1`/`!p2`/`!p3`]
- `!p0`: Critical priority. Must be addressed immediately, potentially dropping other work.
- `!p1`: High priority. Should be included in the current or next cycle.
- `!p2`: Medium priority. Plan to address in the near future, within the next few cycles.
- `!p3`: Low priority. Nice to have, but not crucial. Will be addressed as time and resources allow.

### Communication and Timeline üìÖ

Based on the priority level, please provide the appropriate communication and timeline:

- `!p0`: Communicate immediate action and provide frequent updates until resolved.
- `!p1`: Provide a timeline for implementation (current cycle or next cycle).
- `!p2`: Give an estimated timeframe (e.g., within the next month or quarter).
- `!p3`: Acknowledge the request but explain it's not currently prioritized. Offer to reassess if business needs change.

**Reported Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Target Resolution Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

Milestones:
