## Context & Goals

**Solving**: #[issue number] - [one-line summary]
**Goals**: [In your own words, why are we doing this? What are the current and desired states? Don't propose solutions, keep the solutions for the design section.]
**Success Metrics**: [How will we know we've made progress? What specific metrics/behaviors will change?]


## Design

[How do you intend to achieve the goals? Include enough information to evaluate the design. Wrong is better than vague. Be clear: no passive voice; no bare "this"/"that". This section may include: APIs, pseudo-code/snippets, diagrams, wireframes, etc. Make it easy to change, prefer boring technology, solve the general problem.]

### Technical Details
**Frontend Changes**:
- Containers: [List affected containers]
- Components: [New/modified components]

**Backend Changes**:
- Services: [Affected services/APIs]
- Data: [Schema/pipeline changes]

**Dependencies**: [External systems, libraries, services]

**Testing strategy**: [How will you verify the design works? What new tests are needed? If no new tests, why?]


## Security/privacy/compliance

[Does the design touch/collect user data? Does it open new attack surfaces? How are you storing keys, secrets? If this is not relevant, why?]

## Alternatives considered & Prior art

[What else could work? Why this approach? Prior art?]


<!--
Include the following sections as needed:

## Background

[What additional information is needed to evaluate this design?]

## Trade-offs

[What are the disadvantages of this design?]

## Risks & Mitigations

[What could go wrong? What's the worst that could happen? How do we prevent this worst-case scenario?]

## Dependencies

[What are we expecting from other stakeholders to execute on the design?]

## Operations

[Who will run the designed solution? How will the solution be monitored?]
