# Recover Ag 🌱

At Recover Ag, we envision a future in which farmers can sustain both economic success & environmental stewardship.
We provide agricultural stakeholders with tools for quantifying soil carbon sequestration and other metrics for natural capital.
Natural capital is the stock of natural resources - vegetation, water, soils, and biodiversity - that provide ecosystem services.

## Our technology 🤖🛰️

Using the latest methods in machine learning software modeling, Recover Ag’s quantification system accurately and affordably serves crop systems left behind in the push to promote climate-smart practices.

## Our project & partnerships 🤝

Recover Ag helps farmers bridge the technical barriers to actionable data about their farm’s natural capital.
Our flagship partner is the Oakville Bluegrass Cooperative.
We work in step with emerging climate-smart solutions, employ research and technical expertise across a range of fields, and adapt to the diverse and changing needs of farmers.
